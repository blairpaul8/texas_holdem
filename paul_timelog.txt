Timelog: 
- 1 hour making setting up github repo and setting up files for the project.
  main.cpp CardDeck.h CardDeck.cpp

- 1 hour figuring out how to print player and dealers cards with the symbols. 

- 2 hours writing the deal function to deal to the cards. In order to do this I learned that you can write a copy constructor and assignment overload for a struct.

- 30 minutes learning how to use makefiles and wrote a makefile to standardize how we were compiling the project/ ease of use for compiling all the files together.

- 2 hours writing the score function as a group and final input error checking.

- 1 hour final debugging and commenting the code.
